# PA2 - Numerical Python (NumPy)

This programming assignemnt contains 2 python problems, first is the normalization problem, or also perceived as one of the basic preprocessing techiques in the field of data analytics. 

Under this are the two analytic processes namely centering and scaling. The former is simply defined as the subrtraction of the data from the mean while the latter means dividing with the data's standard deviation. In the first code, we are tasked to create a random 5x5 ndarray and store it in variable X then normalize it. It is known that element-wise mean and element-wise standard deviation can be obtained by using .mean() and.std() calls.

DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM
Moreover, the second problem prompts us to develop a 10x10 ndarray which contains the squares of the first 100 positive integers, and from this data, we are tasked to determine all the elements divisible by 3.
